## Hi, I'm Praise 👋
Data Analyst | Excel • Power BI • SQL<br/>

I turn raw, messy data into clear, actionable insights that help teams make smarter decisions. With 2+ years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked with financial, operational, and business data to build dashboards and analytical models that answer real questions, not just look good.<br/>

My work spans end-to-end analytics: cleaning and transforming data, modeling it for analysis, and designing dashboards that stakeholders can understand and trust. I enjoy bridging the gap between data and decision-making by turning numbers into stories that drive action.<br/>

📊 Real-world projects I’ve delivered:<br/>

1️⃣ Website Analytics Dashboard — tracked traffic, engagement, and conversion metrics to support performance optimization<br/>
2️⃣ Budget allocation vs Utilization Dashboard — monitored spending, allocations, and utilization for better cost control<br/>
3️⃣ Actual vs Budget & Variance Analysis — identified gaps, trends, and drivers behind financial performance<br/>
4️⃣ Bank Statement Analysis — automated transaction categorization and financial insights<br/>
5️⃣ Retail Sales Dashboard — analyzed sales trends, product performance, and revenue drivers<br/>

I have expertise in analytics tools such as Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and SQL while constantly refining my approach<br/>

Let’s build insights that matter.<br/>
